Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech

The project focused on creating a smart thermostat prototype for SysTec, addressing the need to integrate key functionalities like temperature sensing, heating or cooling control, and Wi-Fi data transmission. Three hardware architectures were evaluated: TI, Microchip, and Freescale/NXP. The report strongly favored the TI architecture due to its integrated temperature sensor, peripheral support, and adequate memory. However, the project could improve by considering cost factors and providing a more comprehensive discussion of its alignment with SysTec's business requirements.

The skills gained from this project, such as hardware selection, peripheral integration, and cloud connectivity, are transferable to future IoT and embedded systems projects. To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, the project emphasized clear documentation, well-commented code, and a focus on modularity, with the chosen hardware offering room for future upgrades.
