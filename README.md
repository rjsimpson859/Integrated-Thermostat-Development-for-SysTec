# Integrated Thermostat Development for SysTec
CS 350: Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech

The project focused on creating a smart thermostat prototype for SysTec, addressing the need to integrate key functionalities like temperature sensing, heating or cooling control, and Wi-Fi data transmission. Three hardware architectures were evaluated: TI, Microchip, and Freescale/NXP. The report strongly favored the TI architecture due to its integrated temperature sensor, peripheral support, and adequate memory. However, the project could improve by considering cost factors and providing a more comprehensive discussion of its alignment with SysTec's business requirements.

The skills gained from this project, such as hardware selection, peripheral integration, and cloud connectivity, are transferable to future IoT and embedded systems projects. To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, the project emphasized clear documentation, well-commented code, and a focus on modularity, with the chosen hardware offering room for future upgrades.


### Prototype Development:
Designed and built a prototype smart thermostat utilizing the TMP006 temperature sensor and GPIO-controlled LED functionality. Implemented an intuitive user interface via GPIO-interrupt-driven buttons for temperature adjustments, showcasing foundational embedded systems knowledge.
### Technical Report Authoring:
Developed a comprehensive technical report aligning the prototype's functionality with SysTec's business requirements and technical specifications. Ensured clarity on system architecture, emphasizing the thermostat's low-level functionality and its pivotal role in data transmission to SysTec's server software via UART.
### Architecting Cloud Integration:
Spearheaded the strategic planning phase for connecting the thermostat to the cloud. Conducted an in-depth analysis of Wi-Fi integrated solutions from multiple manufacturers (TI, Microchip, Freescale) to recommend an optimal architecture meeting hardware requirements, ensuring seamless peripheral support, Wi-Fi connectivity, and sufficient Flash and RAM for code execution.
### Problem-solving and Code Optimization:
Demonstrated adept problem-solving skills by structuring code effectively, leveraging switch/case statements for user input processing. Recognized opportunities for code simplification by streamlining input handling, showcasing a growth mindset towards code optimization.
### Enhancing Readability and Adaptability:
Ensured project maintainability by implementing clean, well-commented code. Focused on readability by logically organizing code segments and incorporating extensive comments, fostering adaptability for future modifications or additions to the thermostat functionality without extensive rework.
